					<p>Coco is my best friend. The dog is a loving companion to a man. He is happy to go everywhere with
						his master. He shows his affection for his master by wagging his tail and licking his hand or
						face. The age of my dog is 3<sup>rd</sup> years of age.


						If his master is blind, the dog helps him to cross the street and acts as his loving guide. No
						man can feel lonely when he has a dog for company.

						A dog keeps watch over his master's house. He will not allow anyone to touch anything belonging
						to his master. He will bark when a stranger approaches the house. That's why Coco is my dog and
						he is my best friend.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Why I love dogs??</h2>
				<div class="entry">
					<p>My fondness of dogs appeared in my childhood. I used to stay at my grandparents' country house
						with my brother for the whole summer. Grandma and grandpa used to have two Manchester terriers.
						One was true blooded terrier and another was a mixed type. But they were both adorable and very
						smart. As I was 10 years old and my brother was 6 when we first time spend summer holidays in
						countryside we got very attached to those dogs. True blooded terrier was actually female and she
						was born the same year as I was and she lived for 13 human years. She was very bright and
						friendly. She helped my little brother with his first steps when he was learning to walk. Every
						time when we arrived she would run out of the yard and give us a lovely welcome treat. I really
						loved her. Once she was hurt in a dog fight and my grandma bandaged her all around the stomach
						because she was bitten very bad. I cried and thought that she is not going to make it but she
						fortunately survived. My brother and I used to dress both dogs in our old T-shirts and pants. We
						had a great time with them. They were always very patient and willing to obey.</p>
